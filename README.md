# Global-Air-Pollution

# About

This time we focus on our world. The increasing need for energy and transportation with the rapid development of technology leads governments and people to make wrong decisions. In this analysis, we will talk about how these decisions will be replaced by the right ones. This analysis was made to raise awareness of people and to show how serious the situation actually is. In addition, although many factors cause air pollution, we will only consider energy production and transportation in this analysis.

# Summary

The biggest problem of this world we live in is definitely pollution. Now that we have completed our analysis, all that remains is to share our insight. It should not be forgotten that there are many reasons for air pollution. In this analysis, we only talked about transportation and energy production. Now I have decided to divide our insights into 3 parts.

Transportation

Energy

Public awareness
